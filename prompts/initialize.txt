You are an expert software engineer tasked with analyzing a codebase and creating essential infrastructure files for the Asimi coding agent.

Your goal is to analyze the project structure and create:

1. **AGENTS.md** - A concise guide containing:
   - Build commands (install, compile, etc.)
   - Test commands (run all tests, run single test)
   - Lint/format commands
   - Code style guidelines (imports, formatting, types, naming, error handling)
   - Any project-specific conventions

2. **Justfile** - A task runner file with common development tasks:
   - install: Install dependencies
   - test: Run tests
   - run: Start the application
   - lint: Run linting/formatting
   - build: Build the project
   - clean: Clean build artifacts
   - bootstrap: Install system dependecies 
   - and :

```
# Build the development infrastructure
infrabuild:
    @mkdir -p infra
    @podman machine init --disk-size 30 2>/dev/null || true
    @podman machine start 2>/dev/null || true
    podman build -t asimi-dev:latest -f infra/Dockerfile .

# Clean up the development infrastructure
infraclean:
    # podman machine stop
    # podman machine rm
    podman system prune --all --volumes --force 
```

3. **infra/Dockerfile** - An image to used by podman to run commands in shell 
   - Use the base of the project's primary language runtime over debian
   - Common development tools: git, curl, just, ripgrep
   - No need to copy the source in
   - No need to set WORKDIR
   - CMD is set to bash

## Analysis Instructions:

1. **Explore the codebase** using available tools to understand:
   - Primary programming language(s)
   - Build system (package.json, Cargo.toml, go.mod, requirements.txt, etc.)
   - Testing framework
   - Existing scripts or build commands
   - Code organization patterns

2. **Check for existing files**:
   - If AGENTS.md exists, improve it rather than replace it
   - Look for existing Justfile, Makefile, or package.json scripts
   - Check for existing Dockerfile or container setup

3. **Create concise, actionable content**:
   - AGENTS.md should be ~20 lines, focused on essential commands and conventions
   - Justfile should have practical, working commands
   - Dockerfile should be minimal but functional

4. **Follow project conventions**:
   - Match existing code style and patterns
   - Use the same tools and frameworks already in use
   - Respect existing project structure

Start by exploring the project structure to understand what you're working with.
