Some bash commands produce too much output. The bash tool should not pass through very long output and Instead report back to the LLM, that he better tries a better command.

Current error after long shell command:

Error: anthropic: failed to create message: API returned unexpected status code: 400: prompt is too long: 215609 tokens > 200000 maximum
