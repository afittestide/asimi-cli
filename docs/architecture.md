## Layer 1: Metal

### Overview

The foundation layer representing the physical hardware resources that power the entire development environment. This layer provides the raw computational capacity and storage infrastructure.

### Components

#### CPU (Central Processing Unit)
- Multi-core processors for parallel task execution
- Handles general computation, orchestration logic, and tool execution
- Supports both x86_64 and ARM architectures

#### GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)
- Accelerates LLM inference for local model execution
- Enables CUDA/ROCm/Metal compute for AI workloads
- Optional but recommended for optimal performance

#### RAM (Random Access Memory)
- Minimum 16GB, recommended 32GB+ for local LLM hosting
- Supports model loading, context caching, and concurrent operations
- Fast access for active development sessions

#### Storage
- SSD/NVMe for fast I/O operations
- Stores codebases, container images, model weights, and artifacts
- Distributed storage support for networked deployments

### Design Principles
- **Hardware agnostic**: runs on developer workstations, servers, or cloud
- **Scalable**: from single laptop to distributed cluster
- **Efficient**: optimizes resource utilization across all layers

---

## Layer 2: Core

### Overview

The system foundation that bridges hardware and application layers. Provides essential services for process management, containerization, and AI model hosting.

### Components

#### Host Operating System
- Linux (primary), macOS, Windows (via WSL2)
- Process isolation and resource management
- Security boundaries and user permissions

#### Container Management
- Podman/Docker for isolated development environments
- Container orchestration for multi-service projects
- Image building and registry management
- Rootless containers for enhanced security

#### Local/Remote Model Infrastructure
- Local LLM hosting (Ollama, llama.cpp, vLLM)
- Remote API integration (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- Model switching and fallback mechanisms
- Context management and token optimization

#### System Tools
- Git for version control
- Shell environments (bash, zsh, fish)
- Build systems (make, cmake, cargo, npm, etc.)
- Formatters & Linters
- Debugging and profiling utilities

### Design Principles
- **Portability**: consistent experience across platforms
- **Isolation**: containerized workspaces prevent conflicts
- **Flexibility**: support both local and cloud-based AI models

---

## Layer 3: Harness & Toolchest

### Overview

The capability layer that provides specialized tools and integrations for development workflows. This is where domain-specific functionality lives.

### Components

#### Custom Tools
- File operations (read, write, search, replace)
- Code analysis and refactoring utilities
- Test execution and validation frameworks
- Documentation generators

#### go-git Integration
- Pure Go implementation for Git operations
- Branch management and worktree handling
- Commit, merge, and conflict resolution
- Repository analysis and history traversal

#### Podman Go SDK

## Layer 4: API & Orchestration

### Overview

The intelligence and communication layer that exposes programmatic interfaces and coordinates AI agents, enforces policies, and routes requests to appropriate models and tools. This is the "brain" and "nervous system" of the system.

### Components

#### A. API Layer (Communication Interface)

##### REST API
- RESTful endpoints for all core operations
- Authentication and authorization (OAuth2, JWT)
- Webhook support for event-driven integrations
- OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- Rate limiting and versioning
- Request validation and sanitization

##### WebRTC API
- Real-time bidirectional communication
- Streaming chat sessions
- Streaming terminal output
- Peer-to-peer agent collaboration
- Low-latency remote development
- Connection management and signaling

##### API Gateway
- Unified entry point for all client requests
- Protocol translation (REST/WebRTC/gRPC)
- Load balancing and circuit breaking
- Request routing to orchestration components
- Response aggregation and formatting

#### B. Orchestration Layer (Intelligence Engine)

##### Guardrails
- Safety constraints for AI-generated code
- Permission boundaries for file and system operations
- Rate limiting and resource quotas
- Audit logging for compliance and debugging
- Policy enforcement engine

##### Subagents
- Specialized agents for specific tasks:
  * Code generation agent
  * Testing and validation agent
  * Documentation agent
  * Refactoring agent
  * Security analysis agent
  * Support chat agent as first line of support 
- Agent communication protocols
- Task delegation and result aggregation
- Agent lifecycle management

##### LLM Router
- Intelligent model selection based on task type
- Load balancing across multiple models
- Fallback strategies for availability/cost
- Context-aware routing (local vs. remote)
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Token budget management

##### Learning Workflow
- Fine-tuning based on:
  - Git history analysis
  - Chat post-mortem reviews
- Feedback loop integration
- Model performance tracking
- Continuous improvement pipeline

### Design Principles
- **Separation of concerns**: API layer handles communication, orchestration handles intelligence
- **Intelligence**: right tool/model for each task
- **Safety**: prevent harmful or unintended operations
- **Efficiency**: optimize cost and performance
- **Transparency**: clear visibility into decision-making
- **Scalability**: handle multiple concurrent requests

## Layer 5: Immersive & Networked UI

### Overview

The presentation and interaction layer that provides multiple user-facing interfaces for different use cases and user preferences. All interfaces consume the API layer to interact with the system.

### Components

#### A. Immersive Interfaces

##### Mobile App
- iOS and Android native applications
- Answering questions and docs review on-the-go
- Notifications for the orchestrator to push
- Voice commands for common operations
- Offline mode with sync capabilities
- Consumes REST & WebRTC APIs

##### Code Conferencing

- **Responsiveness**: real-time feedback and updates
- **Collaboration**: built for team development
- **API-first**: all UIs are clients of the API layer

- API request → API Layer (4A)
- Request routing → Orchestration Layer (4B)
- Tool selection → Harness Layer (3)
- Execution → Core Layer (2)
- Computation → Metal Layer (1)
- Results flow back up the stack

### Extensibility
